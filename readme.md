# Do not read

Well, you can if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it

## Technical repo management notes

Note that there are two remotes specified
- github: to use for project management features
- penflip: to use for collaborative writing

And there's a submodule for code which I can keep up to date, but then re-use elsewhere (for example, if we decide to work on a second paper).
