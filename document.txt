# Title

Sepsis and complement profiles in pneumonia

# Abstract

# Introduction

USP for the paper

- breadth of biomarker information
- early in disease process
- serial measurements  to define trajectory

# Methods

## Patients

### Inclusion

- patients pre-organ support
- emphasise short hospital LOS pre measurement
- lowish baseline severity
- drop uninformative, missingness+++ or rare biomarkers (e.g. keep C3/5, drop IL99) -  e.g. IL6/10 and ratio thereof + ?TNF

## Definitions


Primary endpoint - 7 day badness
Secondary endpoints - 28d mortality + others (as a sensitivity analysis)

##  Complement

Blood samples and clinical/outcome data were obtained from patients with
CAP recruited into the SPOTid trial, a prospective observational cohort
study aiming to obtain a longitudinal description of organ dysfunction
in patients with severe sepsis. Ethical approval was obtained for the
study as described in section
(REC ref 10/H0807/78).
